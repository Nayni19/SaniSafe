## Cart Page

The Cart Page of our Sanitary Napkin Website, built using the Document Object Model (DOM), is a crucial part of the user journey. It allows customers to review and manage their selected products before proceeding to checkout. Using the power of the DOM, we ensure a dynamic and seamless cart experience for our valued users.

Upon visiting the Cart Page, customers will find an organized and visually appealing summary of the sanitary napkin products they have added to their cart. Each product is accompanied by an image, product name, quantity, price, and total cost, making it easy for users to verify their selections.

Customers can effortlessly adjust the quantity of each product directly from the cart page. Using the DOM, the page dynamically updates the total cost and ensures that users have full control over their purchases.

The DOM enables users to remove unwanted products from their cart with a simple click. As they remove items, the cart dynamically updates the total cost, ensuring transparency and ease of use.

The Cart Page uses the DOM to perform real-time calculations and display the subtotal, including all selected products' costs. Additionally, it calculates any applicable taxes, shipping charges, or discounts to provide users with the accurate total cost.

For a smooth and uninterrupted shopping experience, the Cart Page offers a "Back to Shopping" button. This button allows users to return to the product catalog or other sections of the website to explore more options.

The DOM powers the "Secure Checkout" button, which directs users to the payment and order processing stage. When customers are ready to complete their purchase, they can click this button to proceed.
